# Compared to classic_moe.py, we removed the scaling_factor argument and hardcoded the MoE hidden size directly from the
# Qwen3 config.
# We also remove the Z router loss, to keep only the (LBL) auxiliary loss, actually it's the "global-batch" LBL variant
# that Qwen use, but no distributed training here, so Global LBL reduces to the classic LBL already implemented.
#
# Added optional weighted shared expert in Qwen3MoE to make it compatible with Qwen3-Next MoE
# This is actually part c) of my experimental "weighting shared experts" with a single expert:
# https://github.com/casinca/LLM-quest/blob/master/llm_quest/experimental/weighting_shared_experts/Readme.md
#
# Added sigma-MoE initialization for the router/gate weights for Qwen3-Next MoE
